# Fast Linear Algebra for Elm

A library for fast vector and matrix math. See the full docs [here][docs].

[docs]: http://library.elm-lang.org/catalog/johnpmayer-elm-linear-algebra/latest/

This is needed for 3D rendering with [WebGL in Elm][webgl], but is useful for
anything where fast linear algebra is needed.

It is based on [the MJS library](https://code.google.com/p/webgl-mjs/) for JavaScript.
